## Description:
  
Burger Logger is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat or have already eaten. When a user submits a burger to the app, it will display in either the "Hungry?" or the "Consumed!" column. Each burger can be "Devoured" or returned to the "Hungry?" column. Lastly, the burgers can be "86'ed" and removed from the database.
